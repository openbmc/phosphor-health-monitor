      "message": "Is 0 actually appropriate?  Wouldn\u0027t 0 be a \"good\" value in many cases?  By setting to 0 here you are actually asserting a threshold when we have a completely idle CPU or we have an empty filesystem.\n\nWe now have in the YAML (and I don\u0027t know if it was there when this ocde was originally written or not):\n\n```\n    - name: CriticalLow\n      type: double\n      default: NaN\n      description: \u003e\n          The lower bound of the critical threshold.  A value of \u0027NaN\u0027 is used\n          to indicate there is no threshold of this type.\n```\n\nI\u0027m sort of confused why we have certain endpoints that are _requiring_ all the thresholds when we have explicitly defined this as a valid state.  By exempting the initialization here we\u0027ll get NaN by default.",
