      "message": "Not sure this is necessary here?  If the high isn\u0027t finite we should have never set criticalAlarmHigh to begin with so the second part is likely to be false.  The premise with your change is that any non-finite criticalHigh means that the threshold isn\u0027t set, so anytime it somehow is set we should clear it, right?",

Many Intel PECI sensors use a differential value rather than an absolute value for instance.\n\nMaybe we should just get rid of this short-circuiting because we end up with slightly different behavior between criticalHigh and warningHigh.",
