      "message": "We should not be setting criticalLow thresholds on utilization sensors.  0 utilization is actually a *good thing*.  I could maybe see setting it to -1, but this seems like a bug in the IPMI implementation if it cannot read sensors without low thresholds set.\n\nThere was a change not too long ago to default unset thresholds to NaN.  Maybe ipmid is not handling this properly?",
