The string contains a more detailed sensor reading (more detailed compared to the existing one).\n\nFor example, for memory usage, its contents will be the contents of /proc/meminfo, as described in the next change in the chain: https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/phosphor-health-monitor/+/37682/2\n\nThere doesn\u0027t seem to be a property of String type in the the existing Sensor interfaces, so I needed to add some interface. I chose the Logging interface on an arbitrary basis; it is purely because it has a String property in it. It is not exactly for logging in the common way logging is done, it is still BMC health metric \"sensor\" data. I would like to know if there is a better choice than using this interface.",

      "message": "What is the content of these messages?  It seems like you\u0027re expecting them to be a programmatic format, but there is no definition of that format by having a free-form string.  Looking later on it looks like one example is that you\u0027re basically using the output format of /proc/meminfo.  How do we know we won\u0027t mess something up in the future by changing the format of the string and break your ipmi-blob-handler?",
